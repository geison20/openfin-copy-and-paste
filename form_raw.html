I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on my contributions and learnings over this semester. During this
period, I maintained a strict commitment to deliveries, ensuring that all deadlines were met without compromising the
quality of work.

I highlight my active participation in the restructuring of the backend for the GM Spaces project, where I had the
opportunity to develop the API and contribute significantly with my expertise in MongoDB and Node.js. This involved
everything from defining the design architecture in collaboration with other developers to providing continuous support
to the team, helping them understand how APIs function. These experiences reinforced my ability as a full-stack
developer, capable of intervening and adding value in various areas of operation within the bank.

In addition to technical skills, I have always strived to promote a collaborative and educational work environment,
prioritizing knowledge sharing and excellence in deliveries. I believe my contribution was fundamental to the goals
achieved by the team, always focusing on quality and innovation.

However, I would like to express a concern regarding the culture of "quick delivery" and "doing things anyhow" that has
manifested at some points in the project. This approach has left me demotivated, as I see that it can compromise the
long-term sustainability of our work, increasing maintenance complexity and the burden on new developers. I believe that
a more consistent standard and careful planning could benefit not only the quality of deliverables but also the team's
morale.

I am open to discussing these issues more deeply and exploring ways we can improve these aspects together. I appreciate
the growth and learning opportunities the bank has provided and am enthusiastic about continuing to contribute to our
team's success.
