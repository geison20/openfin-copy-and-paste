I have been continuously working as a developer on the GM Spaces project, consistently delivering all assigned tasks with a strong focus on quality and meeting deadlines. During this period, I had the autonomy to carry out my responsibilities and made technical decisions that positively contributed to the project.

In addition to my individual contributions, I was available to support the team whenever needed, actively helping solve problems and fostering a collaborative and productive work environment.

I have improved my technical skills, particularly in areas related to artificial intelligence, and have also grown significantly in my communication with teammates and stakeholders. I believe these developments have made me a more well-rounded professional, capable of contributing with greater impact.

I remain committed to continuous learning, always seeking to grow both technically and professionally, with the goal of delivering increasingly better outcomes for the team and the product.
